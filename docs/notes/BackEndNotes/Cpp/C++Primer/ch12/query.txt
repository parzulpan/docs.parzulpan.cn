What are you willing to lose
你准备牺牲什么
You cover your wounds but underneath them
伤痕累累，掩于心底
A million voices in your head that whisper "Stop now"
纵有千声鬼魅，羁绊于耳
Another twist of the knife turn of the screws
依旧披星执剑，向棘而生
It's all in your mind and it's fighting you
纷繁杂念，决于一刻
Arm yourself a storm is coming
紧握双拳，天启将临
Well kid
孩子
What you gonna do now
你现在该怎么做
It's your reflection looking back to pull you down
生存还是毁灭，系于一念之间
So are you gonna die today or make it out alive
坠入无尽深渊，或登临永恒之殿
You gotta conquer the monster in your head and then you'll fly
让鬼魅臣服，你会翱于山巅
Fly Phoenix fly
烈火凤凰，张开双翼
It's time for a new empire
新的王朝，终将降临
Go bury your demons then tear down the ceiling
埋葬阴影，挣脱锁链
Phoenix fly
烈火凤凰，浴火飞翔
And now you're playing with matches come out of the ashes
星星之火，足以燎原
Underneath you a million voices in the crowd they're screaming "Stop now"
千声鬼魅，刺耳嗥鸣
Well let 'em swallow their pride you're turning the tide to true believers
就让阴影吞没过去的荣耀，从死亡走向真正的信仰
Got them in the palm of your hand you're playing God now
命运在握，彷如天神下凡
What you gonna do now
你会去向哪里
It's your reflection looking back to pull you down
生存还是毁灭，系于一念之间
So are you gonna die today or make it out alive
坠入无尽深渊，或登永恒之殿
You gotta conquer the monster in your head and then you'll fly
征服鬼魅，翱于山巅
Fly Phoenix fly
烈火凤凰，浴火重生
It's time for a new empire
新的王朝，终将降临
Go bury your demons then tear down the ceiling
埋葬阴影，挣脱锁链
Phoenix fly
烈火凤凰，浴火飞翔
What you gonna do now
你该去向何方
What you gonna do now
你该去向何方
So are you gonna die today or make it out alive
坠入无尽深渊，或登临永恒之殿
You gotta conquer the monster in your head and then you'll fly
征服鬼魅，翱于山巅
Fly Phoenix fly
烈火凤凰，浴火飞翔
It's time for a new empire
